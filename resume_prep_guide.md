# Preparing Your Resume (Government Style) 

This document contains information that may help you when preparing you resume to apply to positions at U.Group. Specifically those positions supporting our government related clients and programs. 

## Federal Hiring Process & Labor Categories (LCAT’s) 

Hiring within the federal government is a process that’s highly controlled and governed by policies and regulations intended to ensure objectivity and responsible use of tax payer’s money. Some of those controls even extend to government contractors like U.Group. 

Almost all roles within or supporting the federal government are defined by Labor Categories. Each Labor Category also includes a set of very specific requirements that determine if a person is “minimally qualified” for the role. These requirements can come in a few variations, but for our purposes we’ll refer to them as Specialized Experience. When the government is evaluating if a person meets those requirements, they must be as objective as possible which means that the evaluation is based solely on the information contained within that person’s resume. 

## Specialized Experience 

The Specialized Experience required for a given position is often included on the job announcement itself. This section of the job announcement has the critical information that must be present in your resume for you to advance through the application process. Read this section carefully. If you have the special qualifications listed, make sure they are explicitly included in your resume. 

The people evaluating your resume are not allowed to make any assumptions or review anything other than your resume to determine if you meet the specialized experience criteria. You must include everything you want considered in your resume. In addition, the resume reviewer must be able to see you performed a certain task or skill for the number of years included in the requirement. 

Use the Specialized Experience to carefully write your resume when applying. Make sure to include relevant language, so it is obvious how you meet the qualification criteria. Here’s an example of specialized experience could look like: 

**Role: Artificial Intelligence (AI) /Machine Learning (ML) Specialist** 
**Specialized Experience:**
- Five (5) years of experience in the Information Technology field focusing on AI/ML development projects, DevSecOps and technical architecture 
- Experience with architecture & design, including at least three (3) years of experience deploying production enterprise applications in AWS that use AI/ML 
- Experience with large scale, high-performance enterprise big data application deployment and solution architecture on complex heterogeneous environments in AWS. 

## Preparing Your Resume 

You will likely need to update or create new version of your resume that aligns to the federal style to help position yourself to make it through the initial steps of the government hiring process. The following section provides some guidance and recommendations to use when updating your resume. 

When it comes to meeting the specialized experience requirements, words matter. A lot. 

Pay very close attention to the words that are used within the specialized experience requirements and make sure to include those words when you’re describing your work experience, skills, tools, education, etc. 

There is no such thing as too much information when preparing your resume, which may be several pages long and should include detailed information about the jobs you’ve held, your responsibilities, and what you accomplished. 

**General Recommendations** 
- When you’re preparing your application, be sure to reference the specialized experience section of the job post to help you best frame your experience. 
- Don’t get hung up on creating an aesthetically pleasing resume, focus on the content. 
- Be as detailed as possible. Length is not an issue as long as the information you’re including is relevant. 
- For your most relevant, recent, or longest held position, list eight-10 bullet points about your responsibilities and accomplishments. For each prior position, you can list fewer points focusing on the information that is most relevant to the job for which you are applying. 
- Don’t be afraid to use technical terminology if it’s relevant to your current or past roles or to the role for which you are applying. Do avoid acronyms and abbreviations. 
- Automated screening tools aren’t used, so your application will be evaluated by people who have varying levels of familiarity with your professional experience. It’s better to be explicit and not assume the reader has expert domain knowledge or context. 
- Quantify as applicable. 

**Key Information for Each Position** 
This is the information that you should include for each position on your resume. 
- Company/organization name 
- Size of organization (number of employees) 
- Location (City, State) 
- Dates of employment (MM/YYYY) 
- Job/position title 
- Brief description of the organization (one-two sentences) 
- Brief description of the product/project/team you worked on or supported (one-two sentences, if applicable) 
- List of relevant skills, tools, technologies used 
- Specific duties, responsibilities, accomplishments of the position 

### Description of Sections

**Brief description of the organization and brief description of the product/project/team you worked on or supported (if applicable)**

This should provide a context for your work and accomplishments which helps us understand how they’re applicable to our work and the role for which you’re applying. Include the following information: 
- Clients/customers type: public facing, end-users, internal, B2B, civic tech, etc. 
- Impact/performance metrics and scope: users, clients, datasets, uptime, cycle time, etc. 
- Team size/composition 

**Relevant skills, tools, technologies used**

Describing the skills, methodologies, techniques, and tools you used in a position is very important. Be as comprehensive as possible when creating this list, including items that are directly applicable to your work as well as items that are applicable to the team, project or product that you were supporting. Here is an example: 
- Developed new features and provided technical support solutions utilizing the Ruby on Rails framework, Postgres/PostGIS SQL, JSON and Redis while maintaining and deploying to Heroku, Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud technologies including Relational Database Services (RDS) and Elastic Search environments
